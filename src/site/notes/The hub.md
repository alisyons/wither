**Wither** is an extensive worldbuilding and game project by [@alisyons](https://). 

> [!eye] What is Wither?
> All Wither stories play in a world shaped and forsaken by gods. They show facets of different cultures and people living in a time where nothing is certain and too many mysteries are left unsolved. All these mysteries point to something bigger, more sinister playing out hidden from the layperson's eyes and only a select few will come close to figuring out the ways of this world.
