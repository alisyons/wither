Hello, I'm Alisa! You can find me in the virtual world under the name [alisyons](https://www.instagram.com/alisyons).

**Wither** is my multimedia worldbuilding project. Currently, there are concepts for two game projects:

- [[Projects/Gris (game, working title)/Gris (game, working title)\|Gris (working title)]]: a story-centric puzzle game about uncovering a murder mystery through various timelines
- [[Projects/SHRED!!/SHRED!!\|SHRED!!]]: a deckbuilder game about an underground vampire band trying to play in the biggest venue

Alongside a non-creative job I am working on digital illustrations and is planning to dive into the world of game development with these game projects. You can find some of my illustrations under the link above.
