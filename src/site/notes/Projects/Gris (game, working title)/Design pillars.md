Write down your design pillars. This is the foundation of your game and should never change. Your whole design should tie back to these pillars.

For example:

**Intoxicating Creation**

The overwhelming excitement of being able to build anything.

**Thrill of the Unknown**

Excitement, dread and tension of exploring the unknown. No idea what dangers/rewards are down there.

**Cascading Hysteria**

Uncontrollable outburst of emotion, fear, irrationality, laughter, weeping, etc. FTL style chain of "oh sh!t" dependencies, where a failure in one system can affect others, until you're suddenly in trouble.
