# Summary

**Gris is a game about solving a murder mystery across multiple timelines.**

The goal is to collect clues and use them to progress through the ruins of a research institution that has been razed to the ground by an unknown force. Said clues can be found not only in the present, but also in the hazy memories of the murder victims, now persisting as ghostlike apparitions.
